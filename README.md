# Pig Game :game_die:
The perfect game to play with a friend! :couple:
### Rules 
You collect points by rolling the dice. The first of two players who will get at least 100 points is the winner. At any time you can hold your current score and add points to your general score. But don't wait too long - when you roll the 1, all current score is gone and it is the opponent's turn!
### About 
It is the final version of the game. I've done this project during online JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. I've been coding along with Jonas and you can see all taken steps in [JS-exercises](https://github.com/anna-muszynska/JS-exercises) repository.
